# Reinforcement Learning
Easy Implementation of selected Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
for using Pytorch and for now only Cartpole environment from OpenAI gym. Every experiment includes the code (.py) and an execution example (.ipynb).

Included:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Simple Actor-Critic

Working on:
* PPO with GAE
* A2C: Actor-Critic (with multiple agents working synchronous)
