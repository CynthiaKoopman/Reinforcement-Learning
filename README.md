# Reinforcement Learning
Easy Implementation of selected Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
for now using Pytorch and Cartpole environment from gym (OpenAI)

Included:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Simple Actor-Critic

Working on:
* PPO with GAE
* A2C: Actor-Critic (with multiple agents working synchronous)
