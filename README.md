# Reinforcement Learning - Basic
Easy Implementation of selected Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using Pytorch and for now only Cartpole environment from OpenAI gym. Every experiment includes the code (.py) and an execution example (.ipynb).

Included:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Simple Actor-Critic with shared weights
* Actor-Critic without shared weights & GAE
* PPO without shared weights & GAE & early stopping with KL
* PPO without shared weights & GAE & mini batches

Working on:
* DDPG
* RNN with RL
* Parallelized versions
* RL in continuous environment
* RL with a sparse reward function
* Custom environment
* Simple Multi-Agent
