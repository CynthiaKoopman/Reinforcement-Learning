# Reinforcement Learning - Basic
Easy Implementation of selected Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
for using Pytorch and for now only Cartpole environment from OpenAI gym. Every experiment includes the code (.py) and an execution example (.ipynb).

Included:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Simple Actor-Critic with shared weights
* Actor-Critic without shared weights & GAE

Working on:
* PPO with GAE
