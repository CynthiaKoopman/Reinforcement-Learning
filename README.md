# Reinforcement Learning - Basic
Easy Implementation of selected Reinforcement Learning Algorithms using Pytorch on Cartpole and Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI gym. Every experiment includes the code (.py) and an execution example (.ipynb).

Ready:
* Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
* Simple Actor-Critic with shared weights
* Actor-Critic without shared weights & GAE
* PPO without shared weights & GAE & early stopping with KL
* PPO without shared weights & GAE & mini batches
* PPO with continues action space on Lunar Lander environment

Working on:
* DDPG
* RNN with RL
* Parallelized version
* RL with a sparse reward function
* Simple Multi-Agent
